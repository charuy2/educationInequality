  <h4>WHAT COULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES?
</h4>

<div class="p4">
  <p4>The lack of education could facilitate a number of consequences in individuals’ lives. It’s hard to stay informed on important world issues and news without access to these resources, leading to potential threats in communities that are uninformed. Individuals also may face barriers regarding employment and in pursuing their future endeavors without the proper education to back them up.

    WHAT ABOUT WOMEN?
  </h5>

  <div class="p5">
  <p5>
    The gender gap is something seen to this day, where women face considerable difficulty in gaining opportunities for education and employment in the workforce. In under developed nations, this trend is even stronger, where a number of nations provide education to young boys much more readily than to young girls. Traditional gender roles play a large part in this, where cultures have not adapted to western modern ideals and favor boys when investing in education for their children. In recent years the gap has definitely grown narrower, but work still has to be done.
