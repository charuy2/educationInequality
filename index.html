<h3>
  <p1>Millions of individuals in communities all around the world have little to no access to education.
  </p1>
</h3>

<div class="Main" <p2> Immediate access to resources to learn anything you’re curious about is readily available in most
  of the developed world, but for individuals in underdeveloped areas, access to schooling and educational resources are
  scarce. It’s important not to take for granted the ability to receive an education, and with this piece of knowledge
  in mind, it’s up to us to provide support for those who need it.

  <h2>WHAT COULD BE THE CAUSE?</h2>
  <div class="p3">
    <p3>Poverty serves as a main cause for this issue, and in areas where individuals face unemployment, education isn’t
      the first priority even if it is desired. When governments in poverty ridden areas don’t have the funding to build
      facilities such as schools and libraries, or recruit and train educators, it’s hard to establish a good schooling
      system. The digital divide also plays a role, where the lack of access to the internet and technology severely
      limits and restricts opportunities for learning.
